-------------------SUMMARY--------------------
The most important class in the project is GameState, which holds all the players, game managers, and handles game logic.
Inside the GameState is a BoardManager and UnitManager, two very important classes that stores the state of the game.
GameState manages the overall game, passes player turns, and resets the state of the overall game.
BoardManager store the state of the board and has all the Tiles which store good stuff. Each tile has a terrain
and a corresponding height and sprite.
UnitManager has all the existing units on the board. It can change the positions of the units and remove them
from the game.
The renderers are also pretty important for the game too.

------------------SYNOPSIS----------------------
- Difficulty: this is the biggest project I have done so far, and proved to be a challenge for me to code. There is still
so much to code, like multiplayer and an actual good looking UI.
- Fun: pretty cool and good. It was satisfying to see everything come together.
- Final product evaluation: I am satisfied with the current product, though many more features could still be added.
- What I learned: functional programming is cool and good
- Anything good to have known?: not really
